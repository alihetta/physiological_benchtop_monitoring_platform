# Physiological Monitoring Platform

## üìå Overview
This project provides a **multimodal physiological monitoring system** that acquires, processes, and visualizes signals from:
- **Electrocardiography (ECG)**
- **Photoplethysmography (PPG: Red & Infrared)**
- **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)**

The platform integrates **Arduino firmware** for data acquisition with a **Python analysis pipeline** for advanced signal processing and visualization.

**Key features:**
- Real-time acquisition of ECG, PPG, and GSR signals  
- Signal interpolation, smoothing, and peak/trough detection  
- Computation of **SpO‚ÇÇ, Heart Rate (BPM), and Pulse Transit Time (PTT)**  
- Multimodal visualization in an interactive dashboard

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture
1. **Firmware** (`finalized_ecg_ppg_gsr_firmware.ino`)  
   - Runs on Arduino-compatible hardware  
   - Collects raw ECG, PPG (IR + Red), and GSR signals  
   - Streams data via serial for logging and processing  

2. **Python Analysis Pipeline** (`ppg_ecg_gsr_final_code.py`)  
   - Parses raw CSV data from acquisition device  
   - Applies Gaussian smoothing and uniform resampling  
   - Detects:
     - PPG peaks/troughs  
     - ECG R-peaks  
   - Computes:
     - **SpO‚ÇÇ** (ratio-of-ratios method)  
     - **Heart Rate** (from ECG R-peaks, IR peaks, and troughs)  
     - **PTT** (ECG-to-PPG timing differences)  
   - Produces interactive plots (SpO‚ÇÇ, BPM, PTT, GSR)

## üìä Outputs
The Python script generates an interactive dashboard with:
- **SpO‚ÇÇ (%) over time**  
- **Heart Rate (BPM)** from ECG and PPG  
- **Pulse Transit Time (PTT)** trends  
- **GSR signal dynamics**  
- Highlighted **exclusion windows** (e.g., breath-holds)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: Arduino-compatible microcontroller, ECG electrodes, PPG sensor (e.g., MAX30102), GSR sensor  
- **Software**:  
  - Arduino IDE  
  - Python 3.9+ with dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy plotly biosppy
    ```

### Running the System
1. Upload the Arduino firmware (`.ino`) to your microcontroller.  
2. Record physiological data and save as CSV.  
3. Run the Python analysis script:
   ```bash
   python ppg_ecg_gsr_final_code.py
